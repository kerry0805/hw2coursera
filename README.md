# My Homework Two WED201c - Introduction to CSS 
Just started using GitHub to host websites recently, so I messed up with the upload (which can't be more than 25mb) 
If u guys wanna upload the images with smaller size u can download my zip at https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/kerry0805/hw1coursera/tree/main/images
Have to move every single image into images folder so don't mind the rename commit
